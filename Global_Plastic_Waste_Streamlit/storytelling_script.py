## üåç Understanding Plastic Waste

Plastic waste refers to discarded plastic materials that persist in the environment for centuries due to their **non-biodegradable** nature. These range from everyday items like **plastic bags and bottles** to **microplastics**‚Äîtiny fragments resulting from the breakdown of larger plastics.

### üî• Key Impacts of Plastic Waste:

- **üåä Environmental Pollution:**  
  Plastics account for **14% of the solid waste stream** in regions like New York State, highlighting their widespread presence and persistence.  

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Human Health Risks:**  
  Microplastics have been found in **food, water, and household items**, raising concerns about potential links to **cancer and dementia**.

- **üí∞ Economic Costs:**  
  Pollution threatens industries like **tourism and fishing**, leading to declining fish populations and damaged coastal economies.

- **üå°Ô∏è Climate Change Contribution:**  
  Plastic production and degradation release **greenhouse gases**, accelerating **global warming** and extreme weather events.

### üö® The Urgent Need for Action:

- Only **5-6% of plastic waste** is currently recycled in the United States.
- If current trends persist, **plastic pollution is projected to triple by 2060**.
  
üîé **The solution?** A **global commitment** to sustainable practices, innovative solutions, and responsible waste management. The future of our planet depends on it!

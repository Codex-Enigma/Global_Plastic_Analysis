# 🌍 Global Plastic Waste Analysis & Visualization

## 🌱 Project Overview
Plastic waste is a major environmental challenge, impacting marine ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. This project provides an interactive **Streamlit app** and an in-depth **Jupyter Notebook analysis** to explore global plastic waste trends, recycling rates, and actionable insights.

## 📊 Features
### **Streamlit Dashboard**
🔹 **Interactive Filters:** Explore plastic waste data by country, year, and waste type.  
🔹 **Storytelling:** Includes an introduction, visual images, inspiring stories, and recycling tips & solutions.  
🔹 **Dynamic Visualizations:** Engaging Plotly charts, interactive world maps (Folium), and trend analyses.  
🔹 **Hover Tooltips:** Get insights on hover without cluttering the UI.  



### **Jupyter Notebook (EDA & Visualization)**
🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data cleaning, transformation, and statistical insights.  
🔹 **Data Visualizations:** Seaborn & Matplotlib charts for trends, correlations, and distribution analysis.  
🔹 **Geospatial Analysis:** Geopandas and Folium maps to visualize country-wise plastic waste.  
🔹 **Actionable Insights:** Identifying the highest contributors and possible solutions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, plotly, folium
- **Streamlit:** Interactive web-based data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Exploratory data analysis & visualization
- **Data Sources:** Open datasets on global plastic waste statistics

## 📚 How to Use
### **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook Global_Plastic_EDA/"Global Plastic.ipynb"
```

### **Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run Global_Plastic_Waste_Streamlit/global.py
```

## 🌿 Insights & Impact
1️⃣ Top Plastic Waste Producers Dominate

China (59M tons), U.S. (42M tons), and India (26M tons) are the largest contributors.
Plastic waste generation drops significantly after the top three, with Germany, Brazil, and Indonesia at around 6M tons.
2️⃣ High Coastal Risk Areas Need Urgent Attention

44.85% of global regions fall under high-risk zones, posing severe environmental threats.
Very high-risk areas (2.42%) require immediate intervention, as they face extreme plastic leakage into oceans.
3️⃣ Recycling Leaders vs. Waste Producers

Japan leads with an 84.8% recycling rate, while Singapore (59.8%) and South Korea (59.1%) also excel.
The U.S., despite being a top waste producer, is absent from the top recyclers, revealing inefficiencies in waste management.
4️⃣ Per Capita Waste vs. Total Plastic Waste Shows Disparities

Most countries cluster in the lower waste range, but a few extreme values highlight massive differences in waste generation.
Coastal regions remain vulnerable, regardless of total plastic waste, showing pollution risk is not solely based on waste quantity.
5️⃣ Plastic Waste Has Increased Drastically Over Time

Global plastic waste has surged from ~2M tons (1950) to over 380M tons (2023), highlighting unsustainable plastic use.
Industrialized nations remain key contributors, emphasizing the need for stricter policies and circular economy models.
6️⃣ Recycling & Waste Correlations Show Limited Progress

Total plastic waste vs. recycling rate has a weak correlation (0.21), proving high waste production does not guarantee effective recycling.
Recycling rate vs. per capita waste (0.30 correlation) shows that higher per capita waste does not necessarily mean better recycling efforts.

## 🛡️ Future Enhancements
- Machine learning predictions for future plastic waste trends.
- More granular regional data integration.
- User-uploaded datasets for custom analysis.

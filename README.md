# 🌍 Global Plastic Waste Analysis & Visualization

## 🌱 Project Overview
Plastic waste is a major environmental challenge, impacting marine ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. This project provides an interactive **Streamlit app** and an in-depth **Jupyter Notebook analysis** to explore global plastic waste trends, recycling rates, and actionable insights.

## 📊 Features
### **Streamlit Dashboard**
🔹 **Interactive Filters:** Explore plastic waste data by country, year, and waste type.  
🔹 **Storytelling:** Includes an introduction, visual images, inspiring stories, and recycling tips & solutions.  
🔹 **Dynamic Visualizations:** Engaging Plotly charts, interactive world maps (Folium), and trend analyses.  
🔹 **Hover Tooltips:** Get insights on hover without cluttering the UI.  



### **Jupyter Notebook (EDA & Visualization)**
🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data cleaning, transformation, and statistical insights.  
🔹 **Data Visualizations:** Seaborn & Matplotlib charts for trends, correlations, and distribution analysis.  
🔹 **Geospatial Analysis:** Geopandas and Folium maps to visualize country-wise plastic waste.  
🔹 **Actionable Insights:** Identifying the highest contributors and possible solutions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, plotly, folium
- **Streamlit:** Interactive web-based data visualization
